 - [ ] Add the use of an "=" sign into the trianing so ciphey can identify bases easier
 - [ ] Maybe also spaces? Cause bases don't use spaces, and neither do hashes?
-- [ ] A much, much larger dataset / corpus
-- [ ] Check for puncuation too. Sometimes encryptions use puncuation whereas other encodings don't.

+# Dataset ideas
+I need to develop a larger corpus of data, and I've decided to create my own dataset. The dataset will contain:
+* The entirety of the English wikipedia
+* All Reddit comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/
+
+Then, use chi squared on the Reddit comments to only select English looking comments.
+
+Should be a good dataset :)
+
+I might even upload the crypto dataset that Ciphey uses too.
