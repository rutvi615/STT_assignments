 # The internal data packet
-This is the data packet specification Ciphey uses.
+This is the data packet specification Ciphey uses. To pass data around the different modules and to language checker, it is neccesary to use an internal data packet.
 ```python
 {"lc": self.lc, "IsPlaintext?": True, "Plaintext": translated, "Cipher": "Caesar", "Extra Information": "The rotation used is {counter}"}
 ```
+
+# How to contribute
+Ciphey is always in need of more decryption tools! 
+1. Write a decryption tool (this can include encodings such as Base64 too)
+2. For each possible decryption, call `self.lc.checkLanguage(translated)` where `translated` is the decrypted text.
+**Note** by default, all decryption modules when creating get passed Language Checker (lc). Look at this for example:
+```python
+    def __init__(self, lc):
+        self.lc = lc
+```
+3. If result returns `True`, it is successfully decrypted to English. Return the internal data packet but make sure to change the information to match your decryption module.
+4. I'll put your name on the list of contributors!
