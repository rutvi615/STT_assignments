         The way probability distribution works is something like this:
-        {Encoding: {"Binary": 0.137, "Base64": 0.09, "Hexadecimal": 0.00148}, Hashes: {"SHA1": 0.0906, "MD5": 0.>
+        {Encoding: {"Binary": 0.137, "Bases": 0.09, "Hexadecimal": 0.00148}, Hashes: {"SHA1": 0.0906, "MD5": 0.>
         If an item in the dictionary is == 0.00 then write it down as 0.001
         Each parental dictiony object (eg encoding, hashing) is the actual object
         So each decipherment class has a parent that controls all of it
