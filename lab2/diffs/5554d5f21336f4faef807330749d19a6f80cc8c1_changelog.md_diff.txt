 # Change Log
+The changelog for Ciphey.
+
+## Coming up next
+These are taken from the GitHub Issues tab.
+* Improved Neural Network (See /documentation for more information on this)
+* Mod + XOR decryptions
+* Offline mode (No hash lookups)
+* Killswitch - Ciphey kills itself after X seconds. Some decryptions take forever, so if Ciphey is used as a library, waiting 30 - 60 minutes for 1 decryption module to finish sucks. Ciphey will either find the answer in X minutes or seconds, or it will return False.
+* Add screenshots to readme.md (ascii cinema)
+* Creating a Flask version so Ciphey can be implemented as an API. Useful for creating phone / web apps.
