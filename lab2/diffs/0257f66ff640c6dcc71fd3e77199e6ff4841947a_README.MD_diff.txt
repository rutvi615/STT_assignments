 # What is this?
 Ciphey is an automated decryption tool. Input encrypted text, get the decrypted text back.
 > "What type of encryption?"
+
 That's the point. You don't know, you just know it's possibly encrypted. Ciphey will figure it out for you.
 
 Ciphey uses a deep neural network to guess what something is encrypted with, and then a custom built natural language processing module to determine the output.
