 # How to contribute
 Ciphey is always in need of more decryption tools! To learn how to integrate code into ciphey, check out:

-It'd be nice if you wrote some tests for it, by simply copying a function in the Ciphey/tests/test_main.py and replacing the ciphertext with something encoded with your cipher. If you don't add tests, we will probably still merge it, but it will be much harder for us to diagnose bugs!

 # Create more documentation
 Documentation is the most important part of Ciphey. No documentation is extreme code debt, and we don't want that. 
 
-And trust me when I say, if you contribute to great documentation you will be seen on the same level as code contributors. Documentation is absolutely vital.
