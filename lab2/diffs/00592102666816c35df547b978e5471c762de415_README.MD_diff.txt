 That's the point. You don't know, you just know it's possibly encrypted. Ciphey will figure it out for you.
 
-Ciphey uses a deep neural network to guess what something is encrypted with, and then a custom built natural language processing module to determine the output.
+Ciphey uses a deep neural network with a simple filtration system to approximate what something is encrypted with. And then a custom-built, customisable natural languge processing Language Checker Interface, which can detect when the given text becomes plaintext.
 
 Ciphey can solve most things in about 2 seconds.
