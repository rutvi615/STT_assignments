 # âœ¨ Features
 
-- **50+ encryptions supported** such as encodings (binary, base64) and normal encryptions like Caesar cipher, repeating-key XOR and more. **[For the full list, click here](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Supported-Ciphers)**
+- **50+ encryptions/encodings supported** such as binary, Morse code and Base64. Classical ciphers like the Caesar cipher, Affine cipher and the Vigenere cipher. Along with more modern encryption like repeating-key XOR and more. **[For the full list, click here](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Supported-Ciphers)**
 - **Custom Built Artificial Intelligence with Augmented Search (AuSearch) for answering the question "what encryption was used?"** Resulting in decryptions taking less than 3 seconds.
 - **Custom built natural language processing module** Ciphey can determine whether something is plaintext or not. Whether that plaintext is JSON, a CTF flag, or English, Ciphey can get it in a couple of milliseconds.
 - **Multi Language Support** at present, only German & English (with AU, UK, CAN, USA variants).
