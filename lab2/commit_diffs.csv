"1a891bcb54c5c99ed092c32fa3bb03f25d885257","Added new checker and general cleanup

* Added a new checker, What, which uses PyWhat
https://github.com/bee-san/pyWhat

This is a more advanced regex checker and will let Ciphey work on URLs, IP addresses, emails and more!

I also removed dead code in the `brandon` checker.

Also, I added my github sponsors link. This is because I pay for the servers out-of-pocket, and the only way my company will let me receive money is if I was paid it personally (they don't let you start another business).

The servers cost around £11 / month and I currently make £2.80 / month from sponsorships. You can view the costs of the servers anytime. If I make more than the servers than I plan to give it out, like so:
Give_out = total - server_costs / contributors

Where a contributor is defined as ""someone who has contributed 30 PRs in the last 5 months, or one large PR in the last month."". This means that the core team can not receive money if they do not contribute, and allows anyone to contribute and earn money if they wish.","FUNDING.yml","codes/1a891bcb54c5c99ed092c32fa3bb03f25d885257_FUNDING.yml_before.txt","codes/1a891bcb54c5c99ed092c32fa3bb03f25d885257_FUNDING.yml_after.txt","diffs/1a891bcb54c5c99ed092c32fa3bb03f25d885257_FUNDING.yml_diff.txt"

These regex are rare. The idea is that if someone comes across lat / long coords, their next stop is Google Maps. We can take them directly there, eliminating the middleman and improving user experience.
