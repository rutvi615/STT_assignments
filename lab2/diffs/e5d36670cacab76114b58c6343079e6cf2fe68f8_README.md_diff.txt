 That's the point. You don't know, you just know it's possibly encrypted. Ciphey will figure it out for you.

-**The technical part.** Ciphey uses a custom built artifical intelligence module (_AuSearch_) with a _Cipher Detection Interface_ to approximate what something is encrypted with. And then a custom-built, customisable natural languge processing _Language Checker Interface_, which can detect when the given text becomes plaintext.
+Ciphey aims to be a tool to automate a lot of decryptions & decodings such as multiple base encodings, classical ciphers, hashes or more advanced cryptography. 
+
+If you don't know much about cryptography, or you want to quickly check the ciphertext before working on it yourself, Ciphey is for you.

+No neural networks or bloated AI here. We only use what is fast and minimal.

 # ‚ú® Features
 
-- **20+ encryptions supported** such as encodings (binary, base64) and normal encryptions like Caesar cipher, Transposition and more. **[For the full list, click here](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Supported-Ciphers)**
+- **30+ encryptions supported** such as encodings (binary, base64) and normal encryptions like Caesar cipher, repeating-key XOR and more. **[For the full list, click here](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Supported-Ciphers)**
 - **Custom Built Artificial Intelligence with Augmented Search (AuSearch) for answering the question "what encryption was used?"** Resulting in decryptions taking less than 3 seconds. 
-- **Custom built natural language processing module** Ciphey can determine whether something is plaintext or not. It has an incredibly high accuracy, along with being fast.
+- **Custom built natural language processing module** Ciphey can determine whether something is plaintext or not. Whether that plaintext is JSON, a CTF flag or English Ciphey can get it in a couple of milliseconds.
 - **Multi Language Support** at present, only German & English (with AU, UK, CAN, USA variants).
-- **Supports encryptions** Which the alternatives such as CyberChef Magic do not. 
+- **Supports encryptions and hashes** Which the alternatives such as CyberChef Magic do not. 
 - **[C++ core](https://github.com/Ciphey/CipheyCore)** Blazingly fast.
