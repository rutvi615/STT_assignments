+# ü§î What is this?
 Ciphey is an automated decryption tool. Input encrypted text, get the decrypted text back.
 > "What type of encryption?"
 
 That's the point. You don't know, you just know it's possibly encrypted. Ciphey will figure it out for you.
-Ciphey uses a deep neural network with a simple filtration system to approximate what something is encrypted with. And then a custom-built, customisable natural languge processing Language Checker Interface, which can detect when the given text becomes plaintext.
 
+Ciphey can solve most things in 3 seconds or less.
 
-Ciphey can solve most things in about 2 seconds.

-# Features
+**The technical part.** Ciphey uses a custom built artifical intelligence module (_AuSearch_) with a _Cipher Detection Interface_ to approximate what something is encrypted with. And then a custom-built, customisable natural languge processing _Language Checker Interface_, which can detect when the given text becomes plaintext.
+
+And that's just the tip of the iceberg. For the full technical explanation, check out our [documentation](https://docs.ciphey.online/en/latest/howWork.html).
+
+# ‚ú® Features
 
-- **20+ encryptions supported** such as hashes, encodings (binary, base64) and normal encryptions like Caesar cipher, Transposition and more. **[For the full list, click here](https://ciphey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ciphers.html)**
-- **Deep neural network for targetting the right decryption** resulting in decryptions taking less than 3 seconds. If Ciphey cannot decrypt the text, Ciphey will use the neural network analysis to give you information on how to decrypt it yourself.
+- **20+ encryptions supported** such as hashes, encodings (binary, base64) and normal encryptions like Caesar cipher, Transposition and more. **[For the full list, click here](https://docs.ciphey.online/en/latest/ciphers.html)**
+- **Custom Built Artificial Intelligence with Augmented Search (AuSearch) for answering the question "what encryption was used?"** Resulting in decryptions taking less than 3 seconds. 
 - **Custom built natural language processing module** Ciphey can determine whether something is plaintext or not. It has an incredibly high accuracy, along with being fast.
-- **Multi Language Support** at present, only English.
-- **Supports hashes & encryptions** Which the alternatives such as CyberChef do not. 
+- **Multi Language Support** at present, only German & English (with AU, UK, CAN, USA variants).
+- **Supports hashes & encryptions** Which the alternatives such as CyberChef Magic do not. 
 - **[C++ core](https://github.com/Ciphey/CipheyCore)** Blazingly fast.

+<sub><b>A note on magic </b>CyberChef's most similar feature to Ciphey is Magic. Magic fails instantly on this input and crashes. The only way we could force CyberChef to compete was to manually define it.</sub>
+
+
+We also tested CyberChef and Ciphey with a **6gb file**. Ciphey cracked it in **5 minutes and 54 seconds**. CyberChef crashed before it even started.

+Ciphey was invented by [Brandon Skerritt](https://github.com/brandonskerritt) in 2008, and revived in 2019. Ciphey wouldn't be where it was today without [Cyclic3](https://github.com/Cyclic3) - president of UoL's Cyber Security Society.

+Ciphey was revived & recreated by the [Cyber Security Society](https://www.cybersoc.cf/) for use in CTFs. If you're ever in Liverpool, consider giving a talk or sponsoring our events. Email us at `cybersecurity@society.liverpoolguild.org` to find out more ü§†
